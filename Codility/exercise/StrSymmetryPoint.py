"""
Given a string S, returns the index (counting from 0) of a character such that the part of the string to the left of
that character is a reversal of the part of the string to its right.
The function should return âˆ’1 if no such index exists.

For example, given a string:
    "racecar"

the function should return 3, because the substring to the left of the character "e" at index 3 is "rac", and the one
to the right is "car".

Given a string:
    "x"

the function should return 0, because both substrings are empty.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
    - the length of S is within the range [0..2,000,000].
